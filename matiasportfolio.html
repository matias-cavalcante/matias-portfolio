            <h2>My path was messy</h2>
            <p>I started with Codecademy on Html & Css. Then took two years of Software Engineering in the University, and got the hang of
            basics algorithms and Python. Along the way I was taking a short degree as a programmer at another school and I learnt about databases
            and Git/Github. Then on my own through YouTube I learn Java and OOP. Currently I am learning Javascript

            <h2>Where I currently stand and what I have been doing</h2>
            <p>I have some projects you can check on my GitHub profile. Yet please be kind to remember they all made my learning path
            up to this day. You will find some newbyÂ´s work and mistakes here and there, things to be improved and best practices to be
            applied. So there I am going, and this project you are seeing right now, is a sample of it.
